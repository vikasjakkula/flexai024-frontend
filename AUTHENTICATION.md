# Authentication System

## Overview

The authentication system has been updated to provide a better user experience with the following features:

- **Public Home Page**: The `/` route is now public and accessible without authentication
- **Protected Routes**: All other routes require authentication
- **Inline Authentication**: When accessing protected routes without authentication, users see an authentication form directly on the page instead of being redirected
- **Multiple Authentication Methods**: Support for email/password and Google OAuth

## Authentication Methods

### 1. Email/Password Authentication
- **Sign In**: Users can sign in with their email and password
- **Sign Up**: New users can create accounts with email and password
- **Password Reset**: Users can request password reset emails

### 2. Google OAuth
- Users can sign in using their Google account
- Seamless integration with existing Google OAuth setup

## Components

### AuthForm Component
Located at `src/components/AuthForm.jsx`

Features:
- Three modes: signin, signup, forgot password
- Form validation
- Error handling
- Success messages
- Google OAuth integration
- Responsive design

### ProtectedRoute Component
Located at `src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`

Features:
- Wraps protected routes
- Shows loading state while checking authentication
- Displays AuthForm when user is not authenticated
- Renders protected content when user is authenticated

### AuthContext
Located at `src/contexts/AuthContext.js`

Provides:
- `signInWithEmail(email, password)`
- `signUpWithEmail(email, password)`
- `signInWithGoogle()`
- `resetPassword(email)`
- `signOut()`
- User state management
- Loading states
- Error handling

## Usage

### Protected Routes
All routes except `/` are now protected. When a user tries to access a protected route without authentication, they will see the AuthForm component.

### Adding New Protected Routes
To add a new protected route, wrap it with the ProtectedRoute component:

```jsx
<Route path="/new-route" element={
  <ProtectedRoute>
    <NewComponent />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

### Authentication State
The authentication state is available throughout the app via the `useAuth` hook:

```jsx
import { useAuth } from '../contexts/AuthContext';

const { user, loading, error, signInWithEmail, signOut } = useAuth();
```

## User Experience

1. **Home Page**: Public access, no authentication required
2. **Protected Pages**: When accessing without authentication, users see a clean authentication form
3. **Seamless Navigation**: After authentication, users can navigate freely
4. **Persistent Sessions**: Authentication state persists across browser sessions
5. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for authentication failures
6. **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during authentication processes

## Security Features

- Password validation (minimum 6 characters)
- Email format validation
- Secure password reset flow
- OAuth integration with Google
- Session management via Supabase
- Protected route enforcement

## Styling

The authentication forms use Tailwind CSS classes and are fully responsive. The design matches the existing application theme and provides a consistent user experience.
